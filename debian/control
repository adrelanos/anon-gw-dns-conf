Description: DNS configuration Anonymity Linux Distribution Gateways
 Pointing /etc/resolv.conf to 127.0.0.1.
 .
 Whether a Anonymity Linux Distribution Gateway supports system DNS for its own
 traffic in the clear or anonymized mainly depends on the Gateway's firewall.
 .
 Routing the workstation's system DNS through the anonymizer (also known as
 Transparent DNS Proxy) or not is up to the Gateway's firewall as well.
